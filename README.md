# Character Conversation
This is a conversation between two characters. One of which is a machine/ai, the other, is you.
Responses to the machine are a bit speciffic. 
There is a response that can branch the conversation off, however it will end the same every time. 
This was inspired by a game idea I had. 
The best way to go about this is to imagine yourself in the presence of the machine and respond how you think you would.
